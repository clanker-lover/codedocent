# codedocent

**Code visualization for non-programmers.**

A docent is a guide who explains things to people who aren't experts. Codedocent does that for code.

## The Problem

Every tool for understanding codebases is built for programmers. If you can't read the syntax, you can't use the tool.

## The Solution

Codedocent shows code as nested visual blocks - like a schematic. Each block displays:
- Plain English explanation
- Pseudocode translation
- Quality warnings
- The actual code (hidden by default)

Click a block to drill down. Click breadcrumbs to go back up. Export code from any block to work with AI assistants.
